# Module 1: Basic to Advanced Prompting

**Objective:** Transform basic prompts into powerful, context-rich instructions  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Practice Files:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/`

## Overview

Learn the evolution from basic to advanced prompting techniques that generate production-ready code instead of simple snippets.

## Key Concepts

### The Prompting Spectrum
- **Basic:** Simple comments that generate generic code
- **Intermediate:** Specific requirements with context
- **Advanced:** Comprehensive instructions with examples and constraints

### Quality Indicators
- Code matches your architecture patterns
- Includes proper error handling and edge cases
- Follows your team's coding standards
- Reduces manual editing required

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Email Validation Evolution

1. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/basic-email-validator.js`
2. **Try the basic prompt** and observe the results
3. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/advanced-email-validator.js`
4. **Try the advanced prompt** and compare the quality difference

### Exercise 2: API Integration Transformation

1. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/basic-api.js`
2. **Try the basic prompt** provided in the comments
3. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/advanced-api.js`
4. **Try the advanced prompt** and compare how the detailed requirements produce more robust API integration code
5. **Notice:** Error handling, retry logic, and comprehensive documentation in advanced version

### Exercise 3: Component Creation Mastery

1. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/basic-component.jsx`
2. **Use the simple prompt** to create a basic button component
3. **Open:** `examples/basic-to-advanced/advanced-component.jsx`
4. **Use the detailed prompt** that specifies variants, accessibility, and design system requirements
5. **Compare:** How the advanced prompt generates production-ready components with proper TypeScript definitions and accessibility features

## Key Patterns Learned

- **Specification Pattern:** List detailed requirements
- **Context Setting:** Provide background and constraints
- **Example-Driven:** Show patterns to follow
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Build complexity in layers
