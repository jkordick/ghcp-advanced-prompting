# Context Debugging Exercise

This directory contains files for systematically adding context to improve Copilot suggestions.

## Exercise Overview

Practice how different levels of context influence GitHub Copilot suggestions by working through these files in order:

## Files and Exercise Order

1. **`no-context.js`** - Start here with minimal context
2. **`basic-context.js`** - Add basic imports and types
3. **`business-context.js`** - Add business rules and domain knowledge
4. **`full-context.js`** - Complete context with patterns and constraints

## Instructions

1. **Open each file in sequence**
2. **Try the same prompt** in each file: `// Create a user authentication function`
3. **Observe** how suggestions improve with more context
4. **Document** which context additions made the biggest difference

## What to Notice

- **File 1**: Generic authentication code
- **File 2**: Code that uses your imports and types
- **File 3**: Code that follows business rules
- **File 4**: Production-ready code that matches all patterns

## Key Learning

Context is cumulative - each piece of information helps Copilot understand your specific needs better.
